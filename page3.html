            <a href="Index.html">Earth</a> is home to many creatures. They range from cold-blooded to warm-blooded, mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and many other variations.
            Our ecosystems are structured by feeding relationships like killer whales eating seals, which eat squid, which feed on krill. These and other animals require oxygen to extract energy from their food.

            Clusters of specialized, cooperating cells eventually became the first animals, which DNA evidence suggests evolved around 800 million years ago. Sponges were among the earliest animals.
            Over 99 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct.
            Based on the history of life on <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>, the most likely form of alien life is microscopic.

            For the first 3 billion years of life’s existence on <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>, all of it was microscopic.

            There are a lot of creatures living on <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>. A question is posed:</p>
        <h1>Are there aliens among us?</h1>
        <p>
            An interview with Howard Miller about hunting and hound dogs, collected as part of Tending the Commons: Folklife and Landscape in Southern West Virginia collection, documents an individual's experience with a potential UFO sighting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Miller describes a strange light he saw once while hunting with his dogs in 1966 "All at once it was daylight, and I looked up to see what happened. There was a light about that big, going up, drifting up the hill.
            When I looked and seen it just faded out. I've been in the Marines, and know what airplane lights look like, and it was too big for that."

            So what about UFOs or UAPs? By definition, UFOs and UAPs are just things that aren’t identifiable — maybe because a photo is too blurry, or just because the person seeing the object doesn’t know what it is. But for many people, aliens are responsible for these mysterious sightings.
            There is widespread belief, especially in the United States and other Western countries, that aliens regularly visit <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>, maybe just observing us but possibly even abducting people or teaching us advanced building techniques.

            While animals are amazing, some animals can be dangerous to interact with. If you make the wrong move around a lion, porcupine, shark, or even a skunk, the animal will likely attack, leading to disastrous and potentially fatal <a href="page2.html">consequences</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Graceful and sometimes dangerous, jellies range in size from miniscule to enormous. A more accurate term for these marine animals is just “jellies” because, technically speaking, they’re not fish. The term "jellies" refers to a large number of organisms including tunicates, salps, cnidarians and ctenophores.
            The sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri), or box jelly, is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous jellies on <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>. Its potent toxins can cause great pain, scar or even kill people unlucky enough to swim into its tentacles.
            But as long as you're not getting stung, a box jelly is a remarkable creature to behold.

            Poison frogs (also called poison arrow frogs, poison dart frogs and dendrobatids), are the most brightly colored frogs in the world. They live in wet, tropical forests in Central and South America where their diet contributes to the toxins they secrete through their skin.

        <p>
            Poison frogs are known for their beautiful colors, and amphibians that have toxic skin secretions tend to have bright warning colors or patterns. It is theorized that these colors function as a visual warning, a learned response on the part of the predator.
            These frogs are commonly known as poison arrow or poison dart frogs because indigenous community reportedly rubbed their arrow tips on the frogs' backs before hunting. However, only three species have actually been documented being used for this purpose, including the golden poison frog, the most toxic of all frog species.
