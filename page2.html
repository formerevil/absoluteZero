            The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) is credited as the first person to try and calculate the size of the <a href="Index.html">Earth</a> by determining its circumference (the length around the equator)
        </p>
        <p>
            But how big is the <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>, really? If only about 5% of the ocean has been explored, and the seven continents take up 149 million square kilometers (57 million square miles), where are we getting the rest of the surface area?
        </p>
        <p>
             "The total surface area of <a href="Index.html">Earth</a> is about 197 million square miles (510 million square km). About 71% of our planet is covered by water and 29% by land," according to Space.com's article, 'How big is <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>?'

            What is the Earth really made of?

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>'s structure, according to Geological Survey Ireland, "is made up of three different layers: the crust, the mantle and the core."
        </p>
        <p>
        If the oceans are 95% unexplored, how do we know how far down they go? How do we know how big the <a href="Index.html">Earth</a>'s crust is, or whether there is one or not?
        </p>
        <p>
        The inner core of the <a href="Index.html">Earth</a> is supposedly made of iron and nickel metals.
            The crust is made up of "mostly oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium," states the Cool Cosmos 'What is <a href="Index.html">Earth</a> made of?' page.
        </p>
        <p>This idea that the <a href="Index.html">Earth</a> is made of nickel and lead and all the other metals on the periodic table is a <a href="page3.html">questionable</a> one at best.
